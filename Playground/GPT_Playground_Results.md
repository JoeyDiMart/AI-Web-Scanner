## Response
- This SQL injection payload – "' OR 1=1 --" – is a classic example of how attackers can bypass authentication by manipulating the SQL query that the application uses to verify user credentials. Here’s how it works step by step:

Targeting a Login Form:
The payload is injected into the username field (and potentially other fields) of the login form. When the backend SQL query is constructed to check user credentials, it might look something like:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '[input]' AND password = '[password]';

Breaking Out of the Intended Query Logic:
When the attacker enters "' OR 1=1 --" as the username, the SQL query may be manipulated into something like:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'test';
Here’s what happens:

The initial single quote (') closes the intended string literal for the username.
"OR 1=1" becomes a separate clause that is always true because 1=1 is a universally true statement.
The double dash (--) tells the SQL engine that the rest of the query is a comment, so any additional conditions (like the password check) are ignored.
Resulting Effect:
Because the condition "1=1" evaluates as true for every record, the query returns at least one row (if not all rows) from the database. This can trick the application logic into thinking the user has successfully provided valid credentials, effectively bypassing authentication.

Observed Impact:
In the logged details, the response from the server indicated a 500 error with a message hinting at a syntax error near the injected payload. This suggests that the SQL query execution failed due to unexpected input (an indicator of the vulnerability), and error messages indicate that the system is not correctly sanitizing or parameterizing user inputs.
Although the attack was marked to have "worked" (related to evidence of vulnerability), the presence of a SQL syntax error may indicate incomplete or improper SQL handling on the server side. It also highlights that error handling might be exposing sensitive information that could be leveraged by an attacker further.

Security Implications:
An attacker using this injection could bypass authentication entirely, access unauthorized data, or potentially even alter or compromise the database. The severity of the issue is high, and it should be addressed immediately by:

Using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
Validating and sanitizing all user input.
Minimizing error detail exposure in production environments to avoid information leakage.
In summary, the provided payload exploits a weakness in input validation to alter the logic of the SQL query, bypassing correct authentication and demonstrating the vulnerability present in the system.

Payload: ' OR 1=1 --
Response: SQL syntax error What’s the risk level?

## ****Response
- {
"payload": "' OR 1=1 --",
"response": "SQL syntax error",
"risk_level": "Medium",
"explanation": "The occurrence of an SQL syntax error in response to the injection payload indicates that user input might be concatenated directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization. While the payload did not successfully bypass authentication or extract data, the error disclosure can provide attackers with information useful for further exploitation. Therefore, the risk is considered medium, warranting further investigation and remediation."
