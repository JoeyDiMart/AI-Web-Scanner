# Week 1 (8.24.25 - 8.29.25)
## **Summary / Beginning notes**
- GitHub repository was created and shared with Dr. Matt
- Created this document to track weekly updates for the independent study.  
- Weeks will run **Saturday â†’ Friday** to align with weekly meetings (held Fridays).
### Technical updates
- No code written yet, just planning out a roadmap of what this project will look like

### Goals for the upcoming week
- Get a document similar to a ReadMe file that explains the projects goal and how to navigate it
- create the files/directories I might need
- determine what GPT model to use (most likely an OpenAI model)
- have a solid idea of the tools I'll be using 
- would be nice to get a simple "Hello World" test of the API
