# Week 1 (8.24.25 - 8.29.25)
## **Summary / Beginning notes**
- GitHub repository was created and shared with Dr. Matt
- Created this document to track weekly updates for the independent study.  
- Weeks will run **Saturday â†’ Friday** to align with weekly meetings (held Fridays).
### Technical updates
- No code written yet, just planning out a roadmap of what this project will look like

### Goals for the upcoming week
- Get a document similar to a ReadMe file that explains the projects goal and how to navigate it
- create the files/directories I might need
- determine what GPT model to use (most likely an OpenAI model)
- have a solid idea of the tools I'll be using 
- would be nice to get a simple "Hello World" test of the API 


# Week 2 (8.29.25 - 9.5.25)
## **Summary / Beginning notes**
- This week I did research on the different GPT models that OpenAI has to offer. Models like gpt-4o are Omni models, 
are known as "swiss army knives" and do not have internal reasoning. O-series reasoning models (like o3-mini) have 
internal reasoning and think step by step, which I found to be better for security analysis and feedback
- I decided to use the o3-mini model since the mini model is faster with responses and cheaper, then I can go to o4-mini
as development is completed
- I put $15 into my OpenAI account and got my API key
- I'll need to both Omni and O-series models to see what would be best (mostly will come down with speed and reasoning),
but it's possible to use two models and have them do different tasks
- I ran the hello world program 3 times and got a 3 sentence response (under 1 penny spent)

### Technical updates
- generated API key
- created a Playground folder within main project
- created a working "hello world" program to do an API call

### Goals for the upcoming week
- Research on ways to make this project a CLI
- Figure out the project structure (possible each scan having its own python file) etc.
- Implement one scan at least and print out the results 
- look for a website that I can test (see what is secure vs not secure)
