### How to use
# cd AI-Web-Scanner/Docker/dvwa      make sure you're in the directory
# docker compose up -d              to start
# docker compose down               to stop

# username: admin password: password
# http://localhost:8080/setup.php  (can create / reset database)
# all data is lost within this container once you stop it

# expect it to be slow since this is build for amd64 machines
